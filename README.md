shakequiz
=========

An earthquake preparedness quiz built during the International Women's Hackathonin Phoenix, AZ, 2014. 

Shake! was written for a disaster response challenge to help teach people about earthquake preparedness through a quiz game. The initial stage of the project was to draft the questions, which are included in the project repository in a markdown file. Questions were based off of information from the CDC disaster response website. 

The front end of the project was written using HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap. The quiz mechanism is written in Javascript & JQuery.
